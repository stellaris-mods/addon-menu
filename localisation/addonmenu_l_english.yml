addonmenu_test.desc: "§RATTENTION! IMPORTANT INFORMATION!§!\n\nNew Ship Classes & More now has all Feature option choices moved to a new 'menu' called the NSC Features Menu, which is accessed by a new button located in the top right corner of the government view (select your flag in the top left corner of your screen to pop it up). This menu now contains all important NSC feature options, and §Yyou should check it first thing every single new game§!.\n\nUnderstanding this, the Playable Guardians feature is §Gautomatically on§! for ALL players who have Leviathans DLC at the start of every game. If you wish to deactive Playable Guardians, please visit the NSC Feature Menu and simply press the 'off' button.\n\n§RCritical!§! The Guardian System Spawn Choice options are also inside the NSC Features Menu, and if you do not go to the menu at the start of the game and choose which Guardians you want, §Ryou will never see a Guardian outside Enclaves in your game§!. Please visit the NSC System Spawn Control Center inside the NSC Features Menu to do this.\n\nApologizes for the vigorous use of colors, but the NSC dev team wants to make sure you understand this new changeover so you can enjoy NSC as you want to play it. Have fun everyone!"
